## V2.0

This is a simple series of functions which support the various operations
performed on a singly-linked list data structure, including searching and
sorting algorithms.

Ncurses has also been implemented to help provide a better managed display for
showing the list in real time, in addition to status information of the list
itself, such as the number of nodes, the total size of the list, etc.
